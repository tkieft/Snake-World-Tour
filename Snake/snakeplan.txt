Development Plan: Snake-Clone Game

------------------------------------------------------------

Name: Snake World Tour 2006

This game will be a simple clone of snake to get my feet wet and see
if I can actually finish a complete game.  The goal is to get snake
working in the most barebones way, and then try to add all of the
frills such as levels, later

Players: 1 or 2

Goal: You control a snake that moves in 4 directions.  The snake must
avoid hitting itself and the walls while collecting 10 dots on each
level, then exiting through a hole in the side of the wall.  The snake
grows each time it eats a dot, making it longer and the playing field
harder to navigate. In the two player version, each snake has their
own color collectibles, and it is a race to see which snake finishes
first.

Resolution: 640 x 480 (later fullscreen?)

Game Board Size: 35 = 420px
Block Size 12px
